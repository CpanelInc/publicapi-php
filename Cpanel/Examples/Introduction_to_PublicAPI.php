    /**
     * Introduction to the PublicAPI Client Object and Services
     * 
     * The PHP PublicAPI client is a wrapper around the cPanel PHP library.  It
     * provides the programmer with an easy way to create Service objects and 
     * despatch the PublicAPI methods to them.
     * 
     * A Service object represents a set of defined interfaces for communicating
     * with cPanel systems.  For example the WHM Service uses the XML-API
     * interface for making remote calls to a cPanel server on ports 2087 or
     * 2086.  Because it honors the XML-API interface there are methods for
     * invoking native XML-API functions as well as cPanel API1 and API2 modules
     * and functions.  A cPanel Service would do the same, but on ports 2083 or
     * 2082.
     * 
     * A programmer can instantiate a Service object at any time, and without
     * using the PublicAPI client. (remember it's a library!).  However, as your
     * application and scripts get more complex, the PublicAPI client object may
     * be a better way of spawn Service objects.  The PublicAPI client is a 
     * singleton. The main purpose of this is it allow for an internal registry.
     * When Service objects are spawned, the PubicAPI client stores that object 
     * internally.  The object can be accessed at any point during a script's
     * execution, allowing the programmer to have multiple Service instances of 
     * the same type, all with (potentially) unique configurations.
     * 
     * A quick note: The WHM, and the cPanel, Service objects were designed to
     * be backwards compatible with the XML-API client class. Most scripts that 
     * used that class should be able to function will little modification,
     * albeit mostly concerning instantiation and initialization of variables.
     * Also, the cPanel Service object was designed to be backwards compatible
     * with the LivePHP class that ships with the cPanel & WHM product.  Again,
     * there's a high level of compatibility concerning methods calls, however
     * there are a few caveats, namely the cpanelprint() method's return. 
     * 
     * 
     * Using the PublicAPI Client
     * 
     * First, include the Autoload.php file located in Cpanel/Util/.  This is a
     * simply autoload script that registers an __autoload function with the
     * SplAutoload stack.  It will also ensure that the Cpanel/ directory is in
     * the include_path.  These two elements are necessary for the library to 
     * function properly, though you are free to implement them in any way you
     * see fit.  Autoload.php is there for your convenience.

     * conventions of it's sibling Perl client Cpanel::PublicAPI which offers
     * a specific, new set of query methods.
     * 
     * This methods are:
     *  * whm_api($function $func_args)
     *    - For WHM (native XML-API) functions against the WHM Service
     *    
     *  * cpanel_api1_query($service, $mod_func_user_args, $func_args)
     *    - For API1 queries against cPanel or WHM Service

     *  * cpanel_api2_query($service, $mod_func_user_args, $func_args)
     *    - For API2 queries against cPanel or WHM Service
     *    
     *  api_request($service, $url, $HTTP_REQUEST_TYPE, $formdata, $customHeaders );
     *    - For making a direct URL query against a cPane or WHM Service UI
     *    
     * All of these methods are supported directly in the PublicAPI client.
