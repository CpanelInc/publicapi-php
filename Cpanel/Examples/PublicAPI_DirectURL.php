     * is no attempt to parse the result, as it is assumed that the developer is
     * make a direct URL query due to one of the following: 
     * 
     * A) Is triggering a page that performs action, for which there is no API
     *  call and the output is irrelevant
     * B) The output of the page either cannot be parsed programmatically or 
     *  does not need to be parsed by a parser.
     *  
     * The result of this behavior is that the returned object is not directly 
     * iterable.  The raw response can be accessed, just like any response 
     * object:
     * $response = $cp->api_request($service, $url, $httpQueryMethod, $formdata, $customHeaders);
     * $rawResponse = $response->getRawResponse();
     * 
     * Or, the developer can attempt to coerce the result with parser object
     * instantiated from the library:
     * // make the call and get a raw response...
